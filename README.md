# pet-action
Github Action for managing Epic and Subtask Issues

## Usage

When the action is configured in a repo it adds additional automation on issues labeled with 'epic' and 'subtask'.

A issue labeled with 'subtask' can be linked with an issue labeled with 'epic' using a line in the body.subtask

```
This is my description of the issue
[...]
Epic #1
```

`Epic <Reference of the issue>` will tell this action that the Epic needs to update a list of Subtasks in the body:

```
This epic is used for testing purposes.

It will contain a list of subtasks maintained by pet-action github action.

## Subtasks
- [x] Subtask A #2
- [ ] Subtask B #3
```

This action will update the Epic `Subtaks` section with new subtaks or changes in the state of existing subtasks.

## Inputs

### `TOKEN`

**Mandatory** The token used by the action to access and modify repo's issues.access

Typically

          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
